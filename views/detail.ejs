    <h2> ICONS vs We<span>♥</span>Web</h2>
    <p>We are incredibly happy that Léonie Watson is coming over to Amsterdam again to give another talk at an ICONS Meetup.</p>
    <p>Five years ago Léonie gave a talk where she reflected on what User Experience means for someone who is blind. Back then we asked her the question what would make a user interface a pleaure to use. Simply said, back then, a user interface would be a pleasure to use if Leonie could use it to fulfill that task. Even if it would cost quite some troube to do it.</p>
    <p>We asked her the same question again, and we wonder if things have improved in the last years. We certainly hope so.</p>
